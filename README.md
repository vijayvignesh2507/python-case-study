Roll the Dice Game
This is a simple Python program that simulates the roll the dice game. In this game, we throw a dice with six faces, each numbered from 1 to 6, and obtain a random number.

How to Play
Run the Python script.
You will be presented with a randomly generated number between 1 and 6, which represents the result of rolling the dice.
You can choose to roll the dice again by entering "yes" or "y" when prompted.
If you choose to roll again, the program will generate a new random number. If not, the program will exit.
Implementation Details
The program utilizes the random module in Python to generate random numbers. It uses the randint() function to generate a random integer between the minimum and maximum values of a range, which in this case are 1 and 6, respectively.

To allow the user to roll the dice repeatedly, a while loop is used. The program prompts the user if they want to roll the dice again, and based on their response, either continues with another iteration of the loop or exits.

Getting Started
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Clone the repository or download the Python script.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script using the command python roll_the_dice.py.
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
Feel free to modify the code to add additional features or customize the game according to your preferences. Have fun rolling the dice!
